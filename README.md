This is a fork of LiveCloudKd, which was early developed by Matt Suiche [(www.msuiche.com)](https://www.msuiche.com): https://github.com/msuiche/LiveCloudKd.

## LiveCloudKd (2025)

LiveCloudKd is a tool, that allows you to connect to a Hyper-V guest VM with kd.exe (or WinDBG and WinDBG with a modern UI). 

Also, you can use the LiveCloudKd EXDI plugin for attaching to Hyper-V VM.  

The tool uses Hyper-V Memory Manager plugin for operations with Hyper-V memory.
The tool has additional options in comparison with LiveKd from Microsoft Sysinternals Suite:

1. Write capabilities (you can write to Hyper-V VM virtual and physical address space using native WinDBG commands or hvlib API)
2. More performance
3. Support Hyper-V VM with nested option enabled on Intel-based CPU
4. Support multilingual OS

LiveCloudKd. [Download](https://github.com/gerhart01/LiveCloudKd/releases/download/v3.0.0.20250226/LiveCloudKd.v3.0.0.20250226-release.zip)  
Contains EXDI plugin for static dump view:

LiveCloudKd is based on the hvlib.dll library (Hyper-V Memory Manager plugin). Other tools, that were developed using this library:

Methods for accessing guest Hyper-V VM memory: 
```
 ReadInterfaceWinHv - uses Hyper-V hypercall HvReadGPA for reading guest OS memory. Slow, but robust method; 
 ReadInterfaceHvmmDrvInternal - read data directly from kernel memory. Faster, than ReadInterfaceWinHv, but uses undocumented structures. The default reading method is ReadInterfaceHvmmDrvInternal.

 WriteInterfaceWinHv - uses Hyper-V hypercall HvWriteGPA for writing to guest OS memory.
 WriteInterfaceHvmmDrvInternal - write data directly to kernel memory. Faster, than WriteInterfaceWinHv, but uses undocumented structures. The default writing method is WriteInterfaceHvmmDrvInternal.
```

Methods for accessing local operation system memory:
```
 ReadInterfaceLocal - uses for reading data from local operation system memory  
 WriteInterfaceLocal - uses for writing data to local operation system memory  
```

LiveCloudKd was tested on WinDBG from WDK 1809 - 24H2 on
```
Windows Server 2025
Windows Server 2022 
Windows Server 2019  
Windows Server 2016 
Windows 11
Windows 10
```
and some preview versions of Windows 11 and Windows Server vNext

Configure symbol path for WinDBG:

```powershell 
$folder = "C:\Symbols"
New-Item -Type Directory $folder
compact /c /i /q /s:$folder
$symbol_path = "SRV*$folder*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;"+
"SRV*$folder*https://chromium-browser-symsrv.commondatastorage.googleapis.com;"+
"SRV*$folder*https://download.amd.com/dir/bin;"+
"SRV*$folder*https://driver-symbols.nvidia.com/;"+
"SRV*$folder*https://software.intel.com/sites/downloads/symbols/;"+
"SRV*$folder*https://ctxsym.citrix.com/symbols;"+
"SRV*$folder*https://symbols.nuget.org/download/symbols"
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("_NT_SYMBOL_PATH",$symbol_path,
"Machine")

```

for Hyper-V VMs enough:

```powershell  
$folder = "C:\Symbols"
New-Item -Type Directory $folder
compact /c /i /q /s:$folder
$symbol_path = "SRV*$folder*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols"
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("_NT_SYMBOL_PATH",$symbol_path,
"Machine")

```

For launch:

1. Extract distributive to folder and specify path to WinDBG in RegParam.reg, apply it or use /y command line parameter.
    Also, LiveCloudKd can find a path to WinDBG, if it was installed with Windows WDK or SDK.
2. Install Visual Studio 2022 runtime libraries [Link](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe), if it necessary in your environment.
3. Start LiveCloudKd.exe with local administrator privileges.
4. Choose a Hyper-V virtual machine or local Windows for representation it's RAM as dump file.  

LiveCloudKd searches WinDBG in the next steps:

1. Directory, which specifying with /y parameter.

```
LiveCloudKd /y C:\Microsoft\WinDBG
```
2. Windows registry HKLM\Software\LiveCloudKd\Parameters\WinDbgPath key. See RegParam.key for instance. 
3. Standard Windows SDK\WDK, WinDBG or WinDBG with modern UI installation folder (uses registry key for search that path and windbgx command).
4. If the previous result was not successful, LiveCloudKd tries to run kd.exe, windbg.exe or DbgX.Shell.exe from the same folder.

Performance comparison with LiveKd from Sysinternals Suite (LiveCloudKd is more performance about 1000 times using ReadInterfaceHvmmDrvInternal interface for reading memory):

You can view Windows securekernel address space in static mode of Hyper-V VM with VBS enabled option in guest OS.

1. Launch Hyper-V VM with guest OS VBS enable;  
2. Launch LiveCloudKd in EXDI mode;  
3. Enter ".reload /f securekernel.exe=addr" to get securekernel symbols information. You can see securekernel image base address in output window.

      /m        Memory access type.
                   0 - Hypercalls (HvReadGPA and HvWriteGPA)
                   1 - Raw memory
                   2 - Local OS
      /n        Pre-selected number of VM.
      /o        Destination path for the output file (Action 2 - 5).
      /p        Pause partition.
      /v        Verbose output.
      /w        Run WinDBG instead of kd (kd is the default).
      /y        Set path to WinDBG or WinDBG with modern UI (for start EXDI plugin).
      /?        Print this help
``` 

EXDI module can get instructions to write some bytes to Hyper-V virtual machine memory from WinDBG engine (depending on the WinDBG or WinDBGX version), therefore writing memory capabilities are disabled by default.
To enable it enter the command:

```
wrmsr 0x1112 1
```

disable
```
wrmsr 0x1112 0
```
